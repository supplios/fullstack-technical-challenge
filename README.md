# Full-Stack Technical Challenge

Hey there!

Welcome to the Supplios Full-Stack technical challenge! In the repository, you'll find a file called `cars_datasets.csv` with info about used cars in the US. Your task is to work with this data and tackle three challenges to build a web application.

## Our Expectations for a Successful Solution:
- Create a frontend application to showcase results for each challenge.
- Develop a backend application to handle data interactions.
- Let the frontend talk to the backend, fetch the data, and display it to the user.
- Use any language, frontend, or backend framework you fancy. Our usual stack is Django on the backend and Vue on the frontend, but feel free to use what you're comfortable with.

## Challenge 1: Show a list of cars by where they were advertised (state + country)
On this screen you have to show
- number of cars by each state + country
- list of cars by each state + country

## Challenge 2: Show a List of Cars Filterable by Brand, Price, and Color
On this screen you have to
- show filters on brand, price, color (all available values in the dataset)
- implement functionality to request API data with optional filters
- show a list of cars that match the filters

## Challenge 3: Show Summed Value
On this screen you have to
- show summed cars value by each year
- implement functionality to request API data with optional filter parameters for model and mileage range.

## General Steps:
1. Fork this repository.
2. Code the components for each challenge.
3. Test your app thoroughly.
4. Document your code and give clear instructions on how to run it.

## Ready for Submission?
When you're good to go, push your changes to your forked repo and share the link with us.
